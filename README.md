Autoemail
=========

### Admin UI for SMS to email processor
#### User texts in their email address, this app parses it and sends a reply

Use this app to setup a keyword on an SMS API (like ours, at [CarouselSMS](http://carouselsms.com)). Then, you can text in `KEYWORD email@domain.com` and the app will parse it, send an SMS reply to that number and follow up with a pre-written email.


#### Notes:

* API keys and passwords redacted, but otherwise, everything is there.
* It's a Rails 2.3.5 app. It's been operating since that was bleeding edge.
* We use it once in a while - at the end of presentations, for example, but it can definitely be deployed in higher scale environments.
